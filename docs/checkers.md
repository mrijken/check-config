# Checkers

`check-config` uses `checkers` which define the desired state of the configuration files.
There are several checker types (and more to come):

| checker type                                        | description                                                                                 | fixable |  templating |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |-------------|
| [file_absent](#file-absent)                         | the file must be absent                                                                     | yes     | no |
| [file_present](#file-present)                       | the file must be present, indifferent the content                                           | yes     | no |
| [key_absent](#key-absent)                           | a specified key must be absent in a toml / yaml / json file                                 | yes     | no |
| [key_value_present](#key-value-present)             | a specified key with a specified value must be present in a toml / yaml / json file         | yes     | no |
| [key_value_regex_matched](#key-value-regex-matched) | the value of a specified key must be match the specified regex in a toml / yaml / json file | no (unless placeholder is given)     | no |

| [entry_present](#entry-present)                     | a specified entry must be present in the of a toml / yaml / json file                       | yes     | no |
| [lines_absent](#lines-absent)                       | the specified lines must be absent                                                          | yes     | yes |
| [lines_present](#lines-present)                     | the specified lines must be present                                                         | yes     | yes |
| [file_unpacked](#file-unpacked)                     | the file must be unpacked                                                                   | yes     | no |

| [git_fetched](#git-fetched)                         | the git repo must be present and fetched                                                    | yes     | no |
| [package_present](#package-present)            | the package is installed  |  yes  | no |
| [package_absent](#package-absent)                 | the package is not installed  |  yes  | no |

## check-config.toml

The `check-config.toml` is the default entrypoint to define all checkers and
configure check-config:

```toml
include = [  # optional list of toml files with additional checks
    "/home/me/.checkers/check.toml",  # absolute path
    "~/.checkers/check.toml",  # relative to home dir of current user
    "config:check.toml", # relative to the parent dir of this toml
    "py://my_package:checkers/python.toml", # path to file in python package
    "https//example.com/check.toml", # path on webserver
 ]
```

Note: When using a path to a Python package to include checkers, the activated
Python (virtual) environment will be used.

And one or more checkers

```toml
[[<checker_name>]]
<checker specific key/values>
```

Note the double square brackets. We use an array of tables to define the checkers,
so multiple checkers of the same type may exist in the same toml file. If you use
only one checker for a certain type in toml file, you can also use single square brackets.
However, to be consistent and extensible, we advice to always use double brackets.

The syntax is slightly different per checker type. See the next sections for help
about the checker definitions.

### Tags

All checkers can have a `tags` key to make it possible to exclude or include
this checker from the execution.

See [cli tags options](usage.md#tags) for more information about the usage.

```toml
[[lines_present]]
file = ".gitignore"
tags = ["linux"]
lines = ".cache"
```

### Check-Only

When `--fix` is given on the cli, `check-config` will try to fix the checkers. However,
sometimes you do not want a fix a violation, but just check if a previous fix is
performed correct. For example: you unzip a file in one checker and want to check
whether a file is unpacked from the zip. In that case you do not want to create
an empty file by the checker which checks for the unpacked file. To do so, add
`check_only = true` to your checker, like:

```toml
[[file_present]]
file = "path/to/unpacked_file"
check_only = true
```

### Templating

Some checkers support templating. When a checker supports templating, variables
are substitued by their values. Variables are defined in the top level variables
key in the toml files.

```toml
[variables]
date = "2025-10-10"
```

Beside adding the variables to the config, you can add all environment variables via the
`--env` cli option:

```shell
check-config --env
```

In your content, the variables within `${}` are replaced when `is_template` is set to true:

```toml
[[lines_present]]
file = "test.txt"
lines = "date: ${date}"
is_template = true
```

You can escape variable substitution by adding a `\` ie `\${date}`. During execution
the unescaped variant `${date}` will replace the escaped one.

Notes:

- order is important. If variables are inserted after the de definition of a
  checker, they will not be available.
- variables names are case sensitive.
- the values of the variables must be strings.

## File Absent

`file_absent` will check if the file is absent.

The next example will check that `test/absent_file` will be absent.

```toml
[[file_absent]]
file = "test/absent_file"
```

## File Present

`file_present` will check if the file is present.

The next example will check that `test/present_file` will be present. It will
not check the contents.

```toml
[[file_present]]
file = "test/present_file"
```

When the file does not exists, running with fix will create the file. At default
an empty file will be created.

This checker type can handle any text file.

This checker has some options:

- placeholder
- regex
- permissions

### Placeholder

When a file will be created when run with `--fix`, the created file will be created
with the placeholder as content.

```toml
[[file_present]]
file = "test/present_file"
placeholder = "sample content"
```

### Regex Match

Checks whether the contents of the file matches the regex expression.

```toml
[[file_present]]
file = ".bashrc"
regex = 'export KEY=.*'
```

Note: specify the regex as a raw toml string (single quotes) to prevent escaping.

### Permissions

On Unix systems, you can check for the permissions:

```toml
[[file_present]]
file = ".bashrc"
permissions = "644"
```

The permissions need to be defined in the octal representation. See [chmod calculator](https://chmod-calculator.com/)
an explanation.

### Combinations

These options can of course be combined in one definition:

```toml
[[file_present]]
file = ".bashrc"
regex = 'export KEY=.*'
placeholder = "export KEY=hi"
permissions = "644"
```

## File Copied

`file_copied` will check that the file is copied from a file on your system or from
https.

```toml
[[file_copied]]
source = "url or path to file"
destination_dir = "dir on local filesystem"
destination = "path (including filename) on local filesystem"

```

Only on `destination` and `destination_dir`` needs to be specified.
When`destination_dir`is given, the`destination`is created by appending the filename
from the source to the`destination`.
When`destination`is given,`destination_dir` is ignored.

When the parent dir of the `destination` does not exists, the dir is created.

### Templating

This checker supports templating.

```toml
[[file_copied]]
source = "url or path to file"
destination = "path (including filename) on local filesystem"
is_template = true
```

## Dir Copied

`dir_copied` will check that the dir including all contents is copied.

```toml
[[dir_copied]]
source = "path to dir"
destination_dir = "dir on local filesystem in which the contents are copied"
destination = "dir on local filesystem in which the source directory is copied"

```

Only on `destination` and `destination_dir`` needs to be specified.
When`destination_dir`is given, the`destination`is created by appending the filename
from the source to the`destination`.
When`destination`is given,`destination_dir` is ignored.

When the parent dir of the `destination` does not exists, the dir is created.

## Dir Present

`dir_present` will check if the dir including the parent directories is present.
When `permissions` are given, it will also check the permissions.

```toml
[[dir_present]]
dir = "path to dir"
permissions = "755" # optional
```

## File Unpacked

`file_unpacked` will check that the file is unpacked. It can unpack zip, tar.gz and tar files.

```toml
[[file_unpacked]]
source = " path to packed file"
destination_dir = "path to destination directory"
unpacker = "optional override extension"
```

The unpack method is selected based on the extension of the source. When the extension is the correct one,
you can override it via `unpacker`.

## Git Fetched

`git_fetched` will check that the git repo is cloned and fetched.

```toml
[[git_fetched]]
repo = "git url"
destination_dir = "path to destination directory"

# one of the next
branch = "main"
commit_hash = "a1872"
tag = " v1.1"
```

## Key Absent

`key_absent` will check if the key is not present in the file.

The next example will check that `test/file.toml` has no key named `key_to_be_absent`.

```toml
[[key_absent]]
file = "test/file.toml"
key.key_to_be_absent = {}
```

The value of the key is not important; any value will do.

The key can be nested. In the next case it is sufficient that `key_to_be_absent` is not present.
`super_key` will not be removed if it contains also other keys.

```toml
[[key_absent]]
file = "test/present.toml"
key.super_key.key_to_be_absent = {}
```

This checker type can handle different kind of [mapping file types](#mapping-file-types)

## Key Value Present

`key_value_present` will check that the keys specified are present with the specified values.
Keys may be nested. Intermediate keys has to have mappings as values. When intermediate values
are not present, they will be added.

```toml
[[key_value_present]]
file = "test/present.toml"
key.key_to_add = 1
key.key_to_add_also = "value"
```

```toml
[key_value_present.super_key]
file = "test/present.toml"
key.super_key.key_to_add = {"inline_table" = "is also possible"}
```

This checker type can handle different kind of [mapping file types](#mapping-file-types)

## Entry Absent

`entry_absent` will check that all array items `entry.key<.key> = ["item"]` will be removed from the specified
file.

```toml
[[entry_absent]]
file = "test/present.toml"
key.list = [1, 2]
```

This checker type can handle different kind of [mapping file types](#mapping-file-types)

## Entry Present

`entry_present` will check that all array items `entry.key<.key> = ["item"]` will be added to the specified
file, if they do not exists already.

```toml
[[entry_present]]
file = "test/present.toml"
key.list = [1, 2]
```

This checker type can handle different kind of [mapping file types](#mapping-file-types)

## Key Value Regex Matched

`key_value_regex_matched` will check that the keys specified are present and the value matches the specified regex.
Of course, the regex can only match string values.

This checker can only fix when a placeholder is present, otherwise it's check-only. Keys may be nested.
Intermediate keys has to have mappings as values. When intermediate values
are not present, they will be added.

```toml
[[key_value_regex_matched]]
file = "test/present.toml"
key.key = 'v.*'
placeholder = "v1.1"  # optional
```

Note: specify the regex as a raw string (single quotes) to be prevent escaping.

This checker type can handle different kind of [mapping file types](#mapping-file-types)

## Lines Absent

`lines_absent` will check that the file does not contain the lines as specified.

```toml
[[lines_absent]]
file = "test/present.txt"
lines = """\
multi
line"""
```

```toml
[lines_absent]
file = "test/present.txt"
lines = "single line"
```

You can also remove text between markers which removes the markers also

```toml
[[lines_absent]]
file = "test/present.txt"
marker = "# marker""
```

This will change the next text:

```text
Bla
# marker (check-config start)
Bla Bla
# marker (check-config end)
Bla
```

into

```text
Bla
Bla
```

### Templating

This checker supports templating.

```toml
[[lines_absent]]
file = "test.txt"
lines = "date: ${date}"
is_template = true
```

## Lines Present

`lines_present` will check that the file does contain the lines as specified.

```toml
[[lines_present]]
file = "test/present.txt"
lines = """\
multi
line"""
```

```toml
["test/present.txt".lines_present]
file = "test/present.txt"
lines = """single line"""
```

Optionally it can replace strings by regex, i.e. if you want to replace an export with a new value:

```toml
[[lines_present]]
file = "~/.bashrc"
lines = "export EDITOR=hx"
replacement_regex = "(?m)^export EDITOR=.*$"
```

Or you can use marker lines:

```toml
[[lines_present]]
file = "~/.bashrc"
lines = "export EDITOR=hx"
marker = "# marker"
```

Which replaces text from

```shell
alias ll='ls -alF'
# marker (check-config start)
export EDITOR=vi
# marker (check-config end)
```

into

```shell
alias ll='ls -alF'
# marker (check-config start)
export EDITOR=hx
# marker (check-config end)
```

When one of the markers is not present, the markers and the lines will be appended to the text.

Note: because the checkers are executed in sequence, one can add markers in one checker, which are replaced by
a next checker.

## Package Present

You can check if a package is installed on your system and during fix the package can be installed.

At the moment we support the next package types / installation methods:

- Rust / Cargo: installation via `cargo install <package>=<version>`
- Python / UV: installation via `uv tool install <package>=<version>`
- Custom: a custom command to install

At the moment you can only select the package type and not the installer, as there is only
one installer per package type now.

### Python / UV

```toml
[[package_present]]
type = "python"
package = "toml-cli"
version = "0.9.0"
```

### Rust / Cargo

```toml
[[package_present]]
type = "rust"
package = "check-config"
version = "0.9.0"
```

### Custom

By specifying the commands for installing, uninstalling and get the current version,
you can install almost any package.

```toml
[[package_present]]
type = "custom"
package = "uv"
install_command = "curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/0.9.5/install.sh | sh"  # optional for package_absent
uninstall_command = "rm ~/.local/bin/uv ~/.local/bin/uvx"  # optional for package_present
version_command = "uv --version"
version = "0.9.5"
```

Note:

- The version key is optional. When absent, we check whether the package is installed; any version will do.
  During fix, the latest version is installed.
- The commands are executed as the current user. We do not elevate to a system / root user.

## Package Absent

You can check if a package is uninstalled from your system and during fix the package can be installed.

See [Package Present](#package-present) for the configuration, with the difference that the version is not needed.

### Python / UV

```toml
[[package_absent]]
type = "python"
package = "toml-cli"
```

### Rust / Cargo

```toml
[[package_present]]
type = "rust"
package = "check-config"
```

### Custom

By specifying the commands for installing, uninstalling and get the current version,
you can install almost any package.

```toml
[[package_present]]
type = "custom"
package = "uv"
install_command = "curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/0.9.5/install.sh | sh"
uninstall_command = "rm ~/.local/bin/uv ~/.local/bin/uvx"
version_command = "uv --version"
version = "0.9.5"
```

Note:

- The version key is optional. When absent, we check whether the package is installed; any version will do.
  During fix, the latest version is installed.
- The commands are executed as the current user. We do not elevate to a system / root user.

### Templating

This checker supports templating.

```toml
[[lines_present]]
file = "test.txt"
lines = "date: ${date}"
is_template = true
```

## Mapping File Types

The checker types with a key (key_absent, key_value_present, key_value_regex_matched) can we used on several file types
which contains mappings:

| type | extension |
| ---- | --------- |
| toml | toml      |
| yaml | yaml, yml |
| json | json      |

The filetype will be determined by the extension. You can override this by specifying the filetype:

```toml
[[key_value_present]]
file = "test/present.toml"
file_type = "json"
key.key = 1
```

The indentation can be changed by specifying the indentation per checker:

```toml
[[key_value_present]]
...
indent = 2
```
